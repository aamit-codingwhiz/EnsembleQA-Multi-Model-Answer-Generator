A Python-based question-answering system using a combination of state-of-the-art pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The project preprocesses input text, employs an ensemble of models, and selects the most confident answer to user questions. The system enhances the accuracy and reliability of answers by aggregating responses from multiple models.
